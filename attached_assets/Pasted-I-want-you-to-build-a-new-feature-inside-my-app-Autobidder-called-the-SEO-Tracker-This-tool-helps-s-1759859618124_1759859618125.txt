I want you to build a new feature inside my app Autobidder called the SEO Tracker.
This tool helps small business owners stay consistent with their SEO every month and track their progress.

Overview of what it should do

Each user has a 30-day SEO cycle that starts the day they begin.
At the start of each cycle, the progress bar starts at 0% and the goal is to reach 100% before the 30 days are up.

To reach 100%, users must complete:

3 blog posts

3 Google Business (GMB) posts

3 Facebook posts

10 location landing pages

When a user marks something as done, it counts toward their monthly score.
Each type of task has a set value toward the total.
For example:

Blogs might count for 30% of the score (10% each)

GMB posts 25% (about 8% each)

Facebook posts 15% (5% each)

Location pages 30% (3% each)

If they do part of the work (like 2 out of 3 blogs), their score should go up halfway for that section.

What users should be able to do

Start their 30-day SEO cycle

They choose a few keywords they want to target.

The system saves these keywords for that month.

See a progress bar and checklist

Shows how many of each item they’ve done.

Lets them check items off and paste the link (like their blog or YouTube URL).

Updates their percentage automatically.

Generate content ideas

When they choose their keywords, the tool gives them title ideas and post ideas for blogs, Facebook, and GMB.

These ideas can be saved and reused later.

They can click an idea to mark it as “used” or “posted.”

See their history

They can go back and view past months, how much of their SEO they completed, and which tasks they did.

Each past month shows their final percent and the links they added.

How it should work in the background

Each user has their own cycles that last 30 days.

At the end of 30 days, the system locks that month’s results and starts a new one automatically.

The progress bar always reflects their current month’s completion.

Users can always open past months to review progress.

If they finish early, they can keep adding extra posts for bonus practice, but their score stops at 100%.

What I’d like Replit to create

Backend (the data side)

Keep track of users, SEO cycles, tasks (blog, Facebook, GMB, location pages), and content ideas.

Let users add proof links for each post.

Keep a score (0–100%) based on what they’ve done.

Let users view current cycle and all past cycles.

Frontend (the visual side)

A dashboard page showing:

The progress bar

Days left in the 30-day cycle

The checklist of tasks (blogs, Facebook, GMB, pages)

A button to add proof links

A content ideas page where users can:

Enter keywords

Get title ideas for each content type

Save and reuse them later

A history page that shows each past month’s score and what was completed.

Extra details

When users finish tasks, the app updates their score right away.

When the 30 days end, the app automatically locks the month’s results and starts a new one.

Saved title ideas should stay even when new months begin.

The design should be clean and simple (cards, progress bars, checkboxes, and lists).

Summary of what to build

30-day SEO progress tracker that resets each month.

Tasks: 3 blogs, 3 GMB posts, 3 Facebook posts, 10 location pages.

Each task has a specific value toward 100%.

Users can paste proof links for what they post.

A content idea generator that saves titles and ideas.

A history section that shows past months and scores.

Simple dashboard with progress bar, checklist, and buttons.
