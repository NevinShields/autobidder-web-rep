Project: Autobidder CRM
Goal: Create a full CRM system inside Autobidder that helps users manage leads, send automated emails and texts, book jobs, and trigger invoices using Zapier instead of building a full invoicing system in-house.

1. Overview

Autobidder CRM should manage the entire workflow for a home service business:
Lead → Estimate → Work Order → Booking → Zapier Invoice → Follow-Up

It will include:

A lead management dashboard with a Kanban-style pipeline.

Automation tools for sending follow-up emails and SMS messages.

A simple booking system that connects with Google Calendar.

A Zapier integration so users can send invoice data to any app they choose.

A few basic analytics dashboards showing leads, conversions, and revenue.

The interface should feel clean, modern, and easy to use — similar to tools like Housecall Pro, Jobber, or ActiveCampaign, but lighter and faster.

2. How It Should Work (Step by Step)

Lead Capture:
When someone fills out an Autobidder pricing form, a new lead is automatically created inside the CRM.

Estimate:
The system creates an estimate (using Autobidder’s existing quoting logic).
The business owner can review it, revise it, and send it to the customer.
Customers get a link to view and approve or decline the estimate.

Work Order & Booking:
Once a customer accepts an estimate, it becomes a “work order.”
The customer (or business owner) can book a date for the job using a built-in calendar that syncs with Google Calendar.

Zapier Invoice Trigger:
When the job is completed, the CRM sends a webhook (a small packet of data) to a user-provided Zapier URL.
That Zapier connection can automatically create an invoice in QuickBooks, Square, Wave, or any other app.
The webhook data should include the customer’s name, email, job description, price, and completion date.
The user should be able to test their Zapier connection in their account settings.

Automations:
Users can create multi-step automations that send emails or texts based on triggers, such as:

New lead created

Estimate viewed or approved

Job booked

Job completed

Payment confirmed (via Zapier return webhook)
Each automation can include actions like sending an email, sending a text, waiting a certain amount of time, or moving a lead to a different stage.

Templates:
Include a few default email templates, such as:

“Thank you for your request” (after form submission)

“Estimate revised/confirmed”

“Job booked confirmation”

“Job reminder” (1 day before job)

“Thank you for your payment”
Users should be able to edit or turn these on/off.

Analytics Dashboard:
A simple dashboard showing:

Leads by stage

Conversion rate (lead → booked → paid)

Revenue totals

Automation performance (how many emails or texts sent)

3. Design & User Interface

Use a dark theme (dark gray background with blue accents).

Keep everything rounded, clean, and mobile-friendly.

The main sidebar should include:

Dashboard

Leads

Automations

Calendar

Analytics

Settings (where users connect Twilio, email, and Zapier)

Leads Page:

Show a Kanban board with stages like:
“New Lead → Estimate Sent → Viewed → Approved → Booked → Completed → Paid.”

Each card should display the customer name, service, value, and a few quick actions (view, message, send to Zapier).

Automation Builder:

A drag-and-drop visual editor where users connect triggers (like “new lead”) to actions (like “send SMS”) with time delays between steps.

This can look similar to how ActiveCampaign or Zapier’s builder works.

Each step should be saved as a JSON structure so it can run automatically on the backend.

4. Integrations

Twilio: Used for sending SMS messages (each user will enter their own Twilio API keys).

SendGrid or Resend: Used for sending emails.

Google Calendar: Used for booking and syncing job schedules.

Zapier Webhooks: Used for invoicing.

Each user enters their webhook URL.

When a job is completed, the system sends a JSON payload to that URL with job details.

Include a “Send Test Webhook” button so users can verify the connection.

5. Database Objects

The database should have the following entities:

Leads – customer info and current pipeline stage.

Estimates – connected to leads, with pricing and status.

Work Orders – connected to estimates, includes schedule info.

Automations – stores user-built automation flows.

Messages – stores emails and SMS logs.

Zapier Hooks – stores each user’s webhook URL and status.

6. What to Build First (MVP Order)

Build the database and API endpoints for leads, estimates, and work orders.

Create the Kanban view for managing leads.

Add the automation builder with drag-and-drop actions.

Set up the Zapier webhook integration (with test function).

Add Twilio and SendGrid integrations for communication.

Connect Google Calendar for bookings.

Build the analytics dashboard last.

7. Success Criteria

A new lead created from Autobidder instantly appears in the CRM.

Users can revise and send estimates to customers.

Customers can approve and book jobs.

Completed jobs automatically trigger a webhook to Zapier.

Automations run correctly for emails and SMS messages.

The CRM looks clean, runs smoothly, and is mobile-friendly.
