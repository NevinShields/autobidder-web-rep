# Core Concepts

This page provides short definitions for the main building blocks of Autobidder. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of the platform.

## Formula
A formula is a pricing calculator with variables, a formula expression, and optional styling.

## Variable
A variable is a question shown to customers. Supported types include number, text, checkbox, select, dropdown, slider, and multiple-choice.

## Formula Expression
A formula expression is a JavaScript-style math expression that uses variable IDs (and option IDs for multi-selects) to compute a price.

## Conditional Logic
Conditional logic shows or hides questions based on earlier answers. Multiple conditions are supported using AND/OR.

## Design Settings
Design settings control appearance: colors, typography, inputs, cards, buttons, and spacing. Custom CSS can override components.

## Logic Settings
Logic settings control pricing and flow: bundle discounts, sales tax, distance pricing, and required contact fields.

## Custom Forms
Custom forms bundle multiple formulas into one public page with a single URL and embed code.

## Leads
A lead is created when a customer submits a calculator. It includes answers, calculated price, and metadata.

## Automations
Automations are triggered workflows (email, SMS, tags, stage changes, tasks) based on lead or job events.
