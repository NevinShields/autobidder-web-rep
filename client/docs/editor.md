# Custom Form Editor

## What It Is
The **Custom Form Editor** allows you to bundle multiple formulas into a single public page with a clean, shareable URL.

## Typical Use Cases

- Create a single "Request a Quote" page that includes multiple services.
- Build a campaign-specific intake form for marketing purposes.
- Temporarily disable a form without deleting the underlying formulas.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1.  Go to the **Custom Forms** section.
2.  Click **Create Custom Form**.
3.  Set a name and a custom URL slug.
4.  Select at least one formula to include in the form.
5.  Save the form.
6.  Click **Edit** to adjust the name, slug, description, or the list of included services.
7.  Use the **Preview** button to view the public link.

## How It Affects Pricing

- The services you select determine which formulas are available on the form.
- Formulas that are not marked as "displayed" will not appear.
- Changing the slug will update the public URL of the form.

## Examples

- Create a "House Cleaning Estimate" form and select two different cleaning service formulas.
- Use the form's embed code to add the calculator to a landing page.

## Common Mistakes

-   **Broken Links:** Changing the slug of a custom form will break any existing links to that form.
-   **No Services Selected:** You must select at least one service to save a custom form.
-   **Hidden Formulas:** Formulas that are marked as "hidden" will be excluded from the form.
