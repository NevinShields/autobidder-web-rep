# Editor

## What it is
The Editor refers to the **Custom Form Editor**. It lets you bundle multiple formulas into one public page with a clean URL.

## Typical use cases

- Create a single "Request a Quote" page with multiple services
- Build a campaign-specific intake form
- Temporarily disable a form without deleting formulas

## Step-by-step setup / usage

1. Go to **Custom Forms**.
2. Click **Create Custom Form**.
3. Set a name and URL slug.
4. Select at least one formula.
5. Save the form.
6. Open **Edit** to adjust name, slug, description, or services.
7. Use **Preview** to open the public link.

## How it affects pricing/output/results

- Selected services determine which formulas are available in the form.
- Formulas not marked as displayed will not appear.
- Changing the slug updates the public URL.

## Examples

- Create "House Cleaning Estimate" and select two formulas.
- Use the form's embed code on a landing page.

## Gotchas / common mistakes

- Changing the slug breaks old links.
- You must select at least one service to save.
- Hidden formulas are excluded.
