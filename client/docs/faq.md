# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I create my first calculator?

Start by going to the **Formulas** section, where you can create a new formula, add variables (questions), and build the formula expression. Once you're done, you can publish your calculator using the **Embed Code** or by adding it to a **Custom Form**.

## What variable types are supported?

We support a variety of variable types, including **Number**, **Text**, **Checkbox**, **Select**, **Dropdown**, **Slider**, and **Multiple-Choice**.

## Can I hide questions based on a user's answers?

Yes. You can use **Conditional Logic** to show or hide questions based on the answers to previous questions.

## Does styling change the pricing logic?

No. Styling only affects the appearance of your calculator. The pricing logic is handled separately in the **Formula Builder** and the **Logic** settings.

## How do I share a calculator?

You can use the **Embed Code** to embed a single formula on your website, or you can use **Custom Forms** to create a multi-service page with a shareable URL.

## How do Zapier API keys work?

You can generate API keys in the **Integrations** section. These keys are shown only once and are used to authenticate with Zapier using a Bearer Authorization header.
