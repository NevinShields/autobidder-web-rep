# Logic Page

## What it is
The Logic page (Form Settings) controls global calculator behavior: pricing rules, lead capture requirements, and flow settings.

## Typical use cases

- Require contact info before showing price
- Add sales tax or bundle discounts
- Enable distance-based pricing
- Turn on image uploads
- Update step titles and messaging

## Step-by-step setup / usage

1. Go to **Logic** (`/form-settings`).
2. Configure pricing modifiers:
   - bundle discount
   - sales tax label and rate
   - distance pricing rate and type
3. Configure lead capture fields (name, email, phone, address).
4. Enable optional features (image upload, booking).
5. Update step titles and subtitles.
6. Save settings.

## How it affects pricing/output/results

- Bundle discount reduces totals.
- Sales tax adds a percentage.
- Distance pricing adds a travel fee beyond a service radius.
- Required fields block submission until completed.

## Examples

- Enable a 10% bundle discount when multiple services are selected.
- Add sales tax at 8.25% with label "State Tax".

## Gotchas / common mistakes

- Distance pricing needs a business address.
- Too many required fields can reduce completion rates.
- These settings are global across calculators.
