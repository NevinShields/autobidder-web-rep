## Typical Use Cases

- Require customers to enter their contact information before seeing a price.
- Add sales tax or bundle discounts to your pricing.
- Enable distance-based pricing for your services.
- Allow customers to upload images.
- Update the titles and messaging for each step of the calculator.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1.  Go to the **Logic** section (`/form-settings`).
2.  Configure your pricing modifiers:
    *   **Bundle Discount:** Offer a discount when customers select multiple services.
    *   **Sales Tax:** Set the label and rate for sales tax.
    *   **Distance Pricing:** Set the rate and type for distance-based pricing.
3.  Configure your lead capture fields (name, email, phone, address).
4.  Enable optional features like image uploads and booking.
5.  Update the step titles and subtitles to guide your users.
6.  Save your settings.

## How It Affects Pricing

-   **Bundle Discount:** Reduces the total price when multiple services are selected.
-   **Sales Tax:** Adds a percentage to the total price.
-   **Distance Pricing:** Adds a travel fee based on the distance to the customer's location.
-   **Required Fields:** Prevents customers from submitting the form until all required fields are completed.

## Examples

-   Enable a 10% bundle discount when a customer selects more than one service.
-   Add an 8.25% sales tax with the label "State Tax".

## Common Mistakes

-   **Business Address:** Distance pricing requires a valid business address to be set.
-   **Too Many Required Fields:** Requiring too many fields can reduce the number of submissions.
-   **Global Settings:** These settings apply to all of your calculators.
