# Welcome / Overview

Build pricing calculators, capture leads, and deliver quotes without code. This documentation focuses on the core workflow: formulas, design, logic, and publishing.

## At a glance

- Build a calculator in the Formula Builder
- Style it in Design
- Configure behavior in Logic
- Publish via embed or custom form
- Connect automations and Zapier when needed

## Where things live

- **Formulas**: list of all calculators
- **Formula Builder** (`/formula-builder`): variables, formula expression, upsells
- **Design** (`/design`): global theme, component styling, custom CSS
- **Logic** (`/form-settings`): pricing rules, lead capture, flow settings
- **Custom Forms** (`/custom-forms`): multi-service public pages
- **Integrations** (`/integrations`): Zapier API keys
- **Automations** (`/automations/create`): workflow builder

## Typical workflow

1. Create a formula and add variables
2. Write the formula expression
3. Preview and save
4. Adjust design
5. Configure logic rules
6. Publish and share
