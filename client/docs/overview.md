# Welcome to Autobidder!

Autobidder is a powerful tool designed to help you build pricing calculators, capture leads, and deliver accurate quotes without writing a single line of code. This documentation will guide you through the core features and workflows to get you up and running in no time.

## Core Concepts

Before you dive in, let's get familiar with the basic building blocks of Autobidder:

*   **Formulas:** The heart of Autobidder. A formula is a pricing calculator with its own set of questions (variables), a pricing expression, and optional styling.
*   **Variables:** These are the questions you ask your customers. We support a wide range of variable types, including numbers, text, checkboxes, dropdowns, and more.
*   **Formula Expression:** A simple, JavaScript-style math expression that calculates the price based on customer input.
*   **Design Settings:** Customize the look and feel of your calculators to match your brand. Control everything from colors and fonts to button styles and custom CSS.
*   **Logic Settings:** Define the rules and behavior of your forms. Set up bundle discounts, sales tax, and lead capture requirements.

## Getting Started: A Typical Workflow

Ready to build your first calculator? Here's the typical path from creation to publishing:

1.  **Create a Formula:** Start by going to the **Formulas** section and creating a new formula. Give it a name and add some variables (questions).
2.  **Write the Formula Expression:** Use the variable IDs to write a mathematical expression that calculates the price.
3.  **Style Your Calculator:** Head over to the **Design** section to customize the appearance of your calculator.
4.  **Configure Logic:** In the **Logic** section, you can set up pricing rules, lead capture forms, and other settings.
5.  **Publish and Share:** Once you're happy with your calculator, you can embed it on your website or share it via a custom form.
